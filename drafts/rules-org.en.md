## Game description ##
The aim of this entertaining game is to roll your own game pieces as quickly as possible from your starting square across the board to the finish. At the same time, you try to annoy your fellow players and hit their game pieces as often as possible so that they have to start again from the beginning.

The white squares on the board represent the path that all pieces must follow. The pieces of each color begin their journey across the white squares on the colored squares marked with the letter "A". The pieces wait on the B squares to be used. The squares a, b, c, and d represent the finish line for each color. The first player to bring all four of their pieces "home" wins the game.

## Game preparation ##
Each player receives 4 stones of one color. They place one stone on the A field of their color, and the remaining three are placed on the B fields of the same color. The dice is rolled once, and the player who rolls the highest number begins. Play proceeds clockwise around the table.

## Game play ##
The player whose turn it is rolls the dice and moves their playing piece forward on the track in the direction of the arrow by the number rolled. They can jump over their own and other players' pieces, but the occupied spaces are counted.

If you have several playing pieces on the board, you can choose which piece to move next. If the last point of the roll lands on a square occupied by another player's piece, that piece is captured and the player moves their own piece to its place. However, there is no obligation to capture. Captured pieces are placed on the B squares of their color. A player's own pieces cannot be captured; the player must then move another piece, as only one piece may occupy each square at a time. As long as there are still stones waiting to be played on the B fields, none of your own pieces may remain on the A field; they must vacate the field as soon as they have the opportunity to do so. The pieces on the B fields can only be brought into play with a "6" and thus placed on the starting field A.

## Special features of the number "6" ##
If you roll a "6" you get another free roll after your turn. If you roll another "6" you may roll again after moving. If you roll a "6" you must bring a new piece into play as long as there are still pieces on your own B spaces.
The new piece is then placed on square A of the player's own color. If this square is already occupied by another of the player's pieces, this piece must first be moved forward with a roll of "6." If, on the other hand, an opponent's piece is on square A, it is captured. If you roll a "6" and no longer have any pieces on the B squares, you may move one of your pieces six squares forward on the board and then roll again. If you roll a "6" to move your last piece to the finish, you do not need to roll again.

## Entering the finish squares ##
Once a player has completed the entire course with one of their pieces, they move it to the finish squares of their color. The finish squares are also counted individually as the player advances. (For example, if a player is directly in front of their row of finish squares, they can only move to square a with a "1," to square b with a "2," and so on. Pieces can be skipped.) You may not enter other players' finish spaces.

## End of the game ##
The player who is the first to move all of their pieces to their destination squares wins the game. The other players continue playing for the remaining places.

## Game variations ##
Many players play Ludo with additional rules, which we would like to share with you. You can incorporate one, several, or all of these rules into your game as you wish.

### Fewer than 4 players: ###
Since the game is most entertaining when all colors are played, all four colors should be used even in 2- and 3-player games.
If only two people are playing, each player receives two opposite colors (one player receives yellow and red, the other green and black). Each color is played separately. When three people are playing, the fourth color is neutral:
The player whose turn it is can either move one of their own pieces or a neutral piece. The neutral color is then initially only used for capturing. The player who gets all of their pieces to the finish line wins, but only once the four neutral pieces have also reached their destination. If several players have already got all of their pieces to the finish line, the player who gets the last neutral piece to the finish line wins.

### Capturing backwards: ###
If you roll a number that allows you to capture an opponent's piece behind you, you may move
backwards as an exception. However, you may not move onto or past your A square.

### Rolling three times: ###
If you do not have any pieces on the board because all of your pieces have been captured and are waiting on the B fields to be used, you may roll the dice three times. This also applies if one or more pieces have already reached their destination fields, but only if they cannot advance any further from there may roll the dice three times. This also applies if one or more pieces have already reached their destination fields, but only if they cannot advance any further from there. (Example: One
playing piece is already on field c in the destination, the other three are waiting on the B fields. The player may not roll the dice three times because the piece on field c could still advance with a "1".

### Skipping in the finish area is not allowed: ###
No pieces may be skipped on the destination squares. The last piece to "come home" can only enter the destination on square a.

### Barriers: ###
As an exception to the basic rule, two pieces of the same color may stand on one square. These two pieces form a barrier that cannot be jumped over or captured by any other piece. This barrier also applies to the player who built it.

### Compulsory capture: ###
Contrary to the basic rule, opposing pieces must be captured whenever possible. If a player fails to comply with this obligation to capture, the piece that failed to capture is returned to the B squares. If there are several possibilities for capturing, the player can choose one of them.
